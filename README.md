# Raman Laser Sensor Object Detection with Arduino

This project demonstrates how to read data from a Raman laser sensor using an Arduino and display the reflection data on an LCD panel. Based on the reflection value, the program classifies different objects (e.g., metallic or plastic).

## Components Used

- Arduino (Uno, Nano, or similar)
- Raman Laser Sensor (Analog output)
- LCD Panel (16x2 I2C)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Circuit Diagram

Connect the components as follows:
- **Raman Laser Sensor**: Connect the analog output to pin `A0` of the Arduino.
- **LCD Panel (I2C)**: Connect `SDA` to `A4` and `SCL` to `A5` on the Arduino.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/raman-laser-object-detection.git
    ```
2. Install necessary Arduino libraries:
    - [LiquidCrystal_I2C](https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C)
3. Upload the `raman_laser_detection.ino` sketch to your Arduino.

## Usage

After uploading the sketch, the LCD will display the object type based on the reflection data received from the Raman laser sensor. The reflection values and object classification are also sent to the serial monitor for debugging.

## Customization

- You can modify the thresholds in the `loop()` function to classify different objects based on your sensor data.
- Change the `lcd.setCursor()` values to adjust the text displayed on the LCD.
